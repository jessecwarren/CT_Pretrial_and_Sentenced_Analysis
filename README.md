# CT_Pretrial_and_Sentenced_Analysis
by Jesse Warren

This analysis was conducted for the Evans School of Public Policy and Governance class Data Science for Public Policy, taught by Dafeng Xu.
It examines pretrial detention and sentenced data from Connecticut between 2016 and 2020 to answer the following three research questions:
	•What are the characteristics of people in Connecticut in pretrial detention and in prison after being sentenced?
	•What is the impact of pretrial detention and bail on sentencing outcomes?
	•Is it possible to identify people who are at higher risk of being arrested multiple times in order to allocate diversionary resources to this population?
